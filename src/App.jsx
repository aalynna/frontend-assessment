          "Gomu Gomu no Mi, also known as the Fruit of Gum-Gum in French, is a Paramecia-type Demon Fruit that imparts the same properties as rubber to its user's body, making the eater an Elastic Man (ゴム人間, Gomu Ningen). This was once a treasure that Shanks and his crew had taken from a World Government convoy, protected by CP9, but which was accidentally eaten by Monkey D. Luffy"
